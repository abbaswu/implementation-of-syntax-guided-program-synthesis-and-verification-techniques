# Implementation of Syntax Guided Program Synthesis and Verification Techniques

Currently included within this repository are:

- Bottom Up Tree Search Synthesizer and SMT Based Verification Oracle.
- Fuzzing Inspired Random Search Synthesizer and Enumerative Verification Oracle.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook, with a Python 3 kernel and the following extensions:
  - frozendict
  - sympy
  - z3-solver

## Replication Instructions

Run the following Jupyter Notebooks:

1. `bottom_up_tree_search_synthesizer_and_smt_based_verification_oracle.ipynb` for Bottom Up Tree Search Synthesizer and SMT Based Verification Oracle.
2. `fuzzing_inspired_random_search_synthesizer_and_enumerative_verification_oracle.ipynb` for Fuzzing Inspired Random Search Synthesizer and Enumerative Verification Oracle.
